Genetic information in DNA is stored as a long list of strings called Genomic Strings over four letter alphabets A, T, C, G which corresponds to four DNA bases which are as  follows:
1) Adenine (A)
2) Thymine (T)
3) Cytosine (C)
4) Guanine (G)

---Each one above represents one Nucleotide
---Three nucleotides together makes a Codon. 
---Anything between Start Codon named ATG and Stop Codon named TAA, TAG, TGA is a Gene.
---CG Ratio of the nucleotides in the string parameter dna determines the percentage of cytosine and guanine nucleotides present
   in the genome.
   
DNA consists of 30 base-pairs to 3 billion base-pairs which is really complex. 

This is a simple Java Program to perform the following in a DNA Strand: 
1)  Finding all the genes in dna and finding total no. of genes in a DNA Strand
2)  Storing all the genes in dna
3)  Calculating the length of Genes
4)  Finding length of longest Gene
5)  Calculating C-G Ratio 
6)  Finding all genes with length longer than 60
7)  Finding all genes whose C-G Ratio has higer value than 0.35
8)  Counting how may times start and stop Codons occurs in DNA Strand
